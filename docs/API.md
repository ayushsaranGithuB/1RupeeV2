## Coding Standards

- Business logic lives in services/
- Database access only through repositories/
- Never expose ORM directly to routes
- All writes are transactional
- Validate all input with Zod
- Never perform business logic inside routes
- Service layer contains business logic
- Validate all API input with Zod
- Keep files small
- Prefer composition
- Never duplicate business logic

Never delete ledger records.

## Database Architecture

See [architecture.md](architecture.md) for schema, relationships, and indexing details.

## Key Business Rules

### Wallet & Ledger

- Wallet balance is derived from immutable transactions
- Transaction types: TOPUP, DONATION, ADJUSTMENT, REFUND
- Current balance = SUM(all transactions)
- Never update historical transactions
- Adjustments must create new ledger entries

### Payment

- Do not trust client-side payment success
- Only webhooks create wallet credits
- Razorpay handles payment processing

### Donations

- Daily donations processed via CRON
- Never delete ledger or donation records
- Use soft deletes for users, NGOs, and campaigns

### NGOs & Campaigns

- NGOs can have multiple campaigns
- Campaigns can have 3-5 support tiers
- Tiers define daily_amount and impact_description
- Campaign totals updated on each donation
